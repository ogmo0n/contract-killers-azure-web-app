# contract-killers-azure-web-app
CIS370 course project to create an Azure-hosted web application


In this project, I created a Web-based Employee Information
Management System to enable an organization to manage the information
related to its employees. I utilized the cloud development concepts
and techniques acquired from the course to set up the cloud-based Web
application, associated data storage, database and user authentication
system.
